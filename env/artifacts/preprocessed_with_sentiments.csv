this is really uncool, especially within that price.i started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's huge, and i really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... the display is a killer really, i really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.overall i'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone i can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iphone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iphone with all the features and stuff you get.","{'battery': {'score': np.float64(0.25), 'count': 2, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'camera': {'score': np.float64(0.8333333333333334), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'display': {'score': np.float64(0.8333333333333334), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'storage': {'score': np.float64(0.5), 'count': 1, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'design': {'score': np.float64(1.0), 'count': 2, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'price': {'score': np.float64(0.5), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'sound': {'score': np.float64(1.0), 'count': 1, 'sentiment': 'positive'}}",0.25,0.8333333333333334,0.8333333333333334,,0.5,1.0,0.5,1.0

oh yes, i wanted a headphone jack again, which the samsung doesn't have.yes, i have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile.so getting the new moto g power 5g 2023, at $200 was what i was waiting for. here's what i have noticed:a. the screen is cleaner and brighter than my samsung a54, at a lower setting.b. it is actually a little taller and thinner than my samsung a54, and not at wide. so it is easier to hold in my hands.c. charging time is similar when i put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage.d. the front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the moto g, i barely notice it on the samsung.e. setup was very easy. i connected a usb-c, cord between the samsung and moto g, and all of my account information was transferred. i could select not to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since i had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media i always wanted to keep.f. the fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the samsung. which i actually prefer.here are the disappointments:1. this phone is newer than the samsung a54. yet, when i did the geek bench test series on it, the final results were that the moto g power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the samsung. oh, according to geek bench, they have the same processor.2. i'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the power name, that is slapped on it. definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old moto g power 4g.3. when i tested the wifi speed, the samsung a54, downloaded faster, by about 20%.4. this might be user error. but i can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones. the samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings. but i do not see that in the menu of the moto g power 2023, even though they 'both' have android 13.yes, i know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same. i didn't expect it to quite match my old moto g power. but i was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing samsung a54, which last about a day, before i have to recharge it. it seems 10% at best of an improvement.so if you have a samsung a54, and you are looking for performance improvement, i would not buy this phone.but, if you have an older phone, like the samsung a52 (which i had traded in for the samsung a54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299. especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours.perception-someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image, perceived as cheap. that is the image that i want.will i return them? nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that i wanted. but i know that power meaning of the past phones, is not the power meaning of the newer ones.attached photo, sorry about it being sideway. the nord plus phone is at the top (different wallpaper), the samsung is in the middle and the moto g power at the bottom. same wallpaper because it copied over in the transfer.that's it.","{'battery': {'score': np.float64(0.16666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'camera': {'score': np.float64(0.0), 'count': 1, 'sentiment': 'neutral'}, 'display': {'score': np.float64(0.0), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'neutral'}, 'performance': {'score': np.float64(-0.5), 'count': 2, 'sentiment': 'negative'}, 'price': {'score': np.float64(-0.16666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'negative'}}",0.16666666666666666,0.0,0.0,-0.5,,,-0.16666666666666666,

probably not, but everyone has a different budget for everything!when i received the phone, it came in its regular factory box which is very thin, like i was concerned for a second that they just sent me a case, but nope! they've cut down on everything that they send you. it came with the phone, a manual in a tiny box, a sim card tool behind that box, and i believe short type c cable, i already have a charging cable so i didn't pay any attention to it. not that big of a deal really, it just worried me for a second haha.now i'm someone who worries about storage, and this phone does not come with a micro sd card slot (unlike the s20 fe), however i've not had any problems with my storage yet, i still have roughly 61gb out of the 128gb to go. the system itself is 22.5gb which is expected as this is a very beefy and fast machine, and then i play a lot of games so my apps take around 39gb. i don't take many photos either so i only have around 1gb used, but if you are someone who loves to take photos, i recommend getting a separate portable hard drive or even using your personal computer to send your photos over, as spending $70-$130+ for just 128gb of more storage is a lot when you could use that to get around 500gb on a standalone drive. it is also worth mentioning that getting the bigger storage version for this phone, also adds 2gb of ram to it, giving it a speed boost, but i'm about to go over some things about the phone's speed.as for game wise, i play genshin impact, colorful stage/project sekai, stardew valley, pokemon go, and fallout shelter, and this thing runs them all like a beast. i wouldn't recommend getting the extra 2gb of ram in the bigger storage model since this phone can run pretty much anything you throw at it. anyone who's ever played genshin impact knows how heavy the game is, and it can run it at max settings just fine, the only problem, is that it gets incredibly hot. so hot that it lowkey hurts to touch after playing for more than just 5-15 minutes. this could be completely fixed if you get a cooling mount for around $20-30. i do prioritize game functionality and speed over looks so i do play extremely comfortably in low-medium settings as it still looks great! however if you're looking for a gaming machine with smooth fps and no lag at all with maximum settings on heavy games (since bigger temperatures means lowering the processing of your game, causing lag), i'll have to recommend looking for a different phone such as an iphone or a oneplus since they do that well.the camera is good for me! i take photos of my dog and that's it. it also has a 30x zoom which is crazy. the front camera is really good and i sometimes put it up to my head and angle it to make myself look like a goldfish and it's super funny haha. the fingerprint reader works extremely well even with a screen protector. fun fact i found: you can lay your finger over your fingerprint reader while the screen is off and it'll unlock! so you don't even have to double tap your screen to wake it up or press a power button. i was never a fan of 120hz screens and i still am not, but it looks super smooth when i have it turned on. the amoled screen was a huge game changer for me, it's beautiful and has incredible contrasting colors. i know people say they have tons of issues with the battery to this device, but i honestly haven't had any problems whatsoever. now i do keep medium power saving mode on as i just don't see too much to the use of allowing your phone to do any big background services when you're not using it. it lasts about a day and a half. i work 9-5 and i come home with 70% battery after being on it or checking it very often and frequently. now i will say there has been some connectivity issues during heavy storms and heavy storms only, but i experienced that issue with my last phone so there's a massive chance that's just my mobile data provider (which is us cellular). by the way, this phone is unlocked, so it should be able to accept just about any other provider you use. i also think it supports 2 sim cards? i'm not too sure as i'm not someone who would ever have to use it, but if you are, then that's a plus.overall this phone is absolutely amazing and i 11/10 recommend it :)","{'battery': {'score': np.float64(0.3333333333333333), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'camera': {'score': np.float64(-0.16666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'negative'}, 'display': {'score': np.float64(0.6666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'performance': {'score': np.float64(0.16666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'storage': {'score': np.float64(0.16666666666666666), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'design': {'score': np.float64(0.5), 'count': 2, 'sentiment': 'positive'}, 'price': {'score': np.float64(0.3333333333333333), 'count': 3, 'sentiment': 'positive'}}",0.3333333333333333,-0.16666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666,0.5,0.3333333333333333,

(now i need a contract so i can confirm things with texts. it's a conspiracy, man!!!) i suspect this model was popular a few years ago. now it is out of fashion, but still entirely functional. combine it with a tracphone $60.00 per year plan, and you are good to go for occasionally receiving/sending occasional texts, or having a means of contacting people when you aren't near your primary phone(s). you can also disconnect in the middle of a diatribe, and then blame it on having an older model phone. (i really miss ""hanging-up"", touching the disconnect icon just doesn't have the same closure. motorola needs to add a sound effect of a phone receiver slamming down when you disconnect. hmmm, now that i think of it, it may already exist. hmmm, if it doesn't exist, maybe i can copyright it. be right back, gonna check... dang! there are 103 sound effects to download. i'll check them out later to see if there is a slamming phone receiver. don't steal my idea.) warning: this is a ""locked"" phone. that means that you must use a tracphone contract. if you buy this phone, don't complain that an att, t-mobile, or joe's budget cell phone plan with free fries, doesn't work. <shrug> sorry, i couldn't rate battery life or tech support. i don't use it heavily, and i don't have it off the charger for days at a time. i haven't needed tech support.",,,,,,,,,

i no longer need to bring a dedicated digital camera when i'm traveling or attending major celebrations like graduations that need a good camera. it's performance in low-light conditions is fantastic and really something to write home about. sure, my brother's iphone 11 pro has a better camera, but he paid over $1000 for it, so that's not a fair comparison. i'd say that the pixel 3a's camera and camera software is every bit as good as my wife's galaxy 10, if not better.battery life: a full charge doesn't last the 2-3 days that my old moto z play did, but the rapid charging feature makes it not matter as much. in my daily commute of 20-30 minutes to work, i can add about 30-40% to my battery, which means i never have to worry about my phone going dead, even if i forget to charge it at night. a full charge tends to last a little over a day with heavy use. for the record, nearly every day i browse the internet for hours, play sudoku, listen to spotify, and post and browse on instagram, twitter, and facebook.hardware: it's not a flagship phone, so it's not going to hold up to intensive use. that said, nothing i've thrown at it so far as crashed it. like i said, i'm a heavy phone user. i don't have to close my apps before switching to another one like i did with my last phone to avoid crashes. i also have experienced hangs like i did with my last phone either. this really does everything you need it to do. i don't think that a normal to heavy phone user needs much more power than this unless they're gaming or photo editing on their phone or something. the bluetooth works a lot better than my old phones did. i have an aging 2013 prius that does not like to play nice with bluetooth in a lot of my devices. i get in the car, and the phone automatically hooks to the bluetooth and brings up my last spotify podcast without me fussing with it past the initial setup. i forgot how nice it was when things just worked, you know?look & feel: i really like that it's lighter than my last phone even though the screen and the screen's resolution is much larger. it doesn't have a trendy notch, but i don't really care. the fingerprint is located in a nice place in the back that feels very intuitive. there is a feature that lets you squeeze the phone to bring up google assistant that i could see some people enjoying, but i never use it because my hands are too small to put enough pressure on the phone to bring it up. some people may dock a point or two for this, if it's important to you. i don't because i can just shout ""hey google"" at the phone to the same effect, and perhaps the feature works fine if you don't have tiny baby hands like me and buy a phone that's over 6 inches. the phone itself is mostly metal and glass and doesn't feel cheap. i don't think it looks like you spent less than $400 on it at all. most importantly, it still has an aux port. not all of us want the hassle of charging and keeping track of bluetooth earbuds that can cost more than your phone and don't sound any better than a $10 wired headset you can get at the pharmacy. the screen is absolutely huge and the resolution makes everything tiny. i don't have bad eyes and i'm not an old maid, but i had to set the text size to ""large"" otherwise every website looks like those old myspace profiles people made back in 2002 with size-6 font. it's very comfortable to read on; i don't feel like someone would need a dedicated tablet with a phone with a screen this big.software & os/ui: if you're getting an android os, you've probably fine with the os. that said, google's ui is so much better than everyone else's (i've used uis by asus, samsung, and motorola in other phones). the home screen is easier to customize, the app launcher makes sense, and the app switcher is intuitive and quick. since it's google, you'll have the newest android os's at launch and support for longer than other manufacturers. that was one thing i missed dearly about my old nexus, and i'm glad google is finally back in the sub-$500 market again so i can take advantage of it. i think my favorite feature about the ui is that i can turn on ""dark mode"" 24/7 so that i never have white bars or menus anywhere, just nice black ones. it's really saved my eyes. i also like that the volume and brightness on the phone has a very wide range of levels, much moreso than any other phone i've had before, which always had ""silent,"" ""soft-ish"" and ""extremely loud"" with little in between. i can turn down the volume to almost-silent and the brightness to actually quite dark without installing third party apps. also, there's no bloatware on the phone when you purchase it. that's really nice.all in all, it's a very solid phone and i'm honestly thrilled with how nice the screen and camera is at this price-point. everything else i've looked at with comparable specs and features is at least $100 more. i've been using mine for the past couple of weeks, and every day i like it more. full five stars from me.",,,,,,,,,

then again, there is something to be said about having a healthy work/life balance. with that in mind, i was curious when i heard about the 3a coming to the market... as much as i love the 3 xl, i can't say that i was super excited to spend $900 on a phone. when the 3a xl dropped below $300 (after the deal that gave you a $100 gc), it seemed like a no brainer.as someone that has both a 3xl and a 3a xl, here's what i can tell you:screenunlike the 3 xl, the 3a xl has no screen ""notch"". where there are some parts of the ui that take advantage of the notch, there are just as many applications that leave an annoying color (non-black) artifact in the notch area when watching landscape full-screen video - it's super annoying. the 3a xl's screen is slightly smaller than the 3 xl, and while it's also a little lower resolution, the density (as a result of the smaller diagonal measurement) doesn't drop that much. in general usage i don't notice any difference. the 3a's screen is oled, but it appears to be a quality tier below the 3 xl's... you can see it if they are side-by-side, but you wouldn't notice it if you were going from memory.camerapixel phones are renown for their camera performance. while the raw specs tend to be behind other flagship phones' optics and ccds, the actual picture quality tends to be at or near the top of the heap. the pixel 3a xl is no different, as the rear camera is the same as the one on the 3 xl. the front camera (which i really don't care as much about) goes with a single, rather than a dual, camera setup. it's not the same as either front-facing camera on the pixel 3 xl, but the software (which is largely responsible for the picture quality), is the same. both cameras appear to be excellent.form factorthe pixel 3a xl is slightly larger than the pixel 3 xl. some of it may be due to the notch-less screen causing the speaker and camera to be mounted above the screen. some may be due to the larger capacity battery. perhaps it's also influenced by the case material on the back being made of plastic, rather than glass. regardless, the phone is about 10% lighter, which is enough to be noticable. an omission that i don't love is that the 3a xl does not support wireless chaging... it's not the end of the world, but it is missed.performancethe 3a xl does have a significantly slower cpu than the 3 xl. the layout of both processors is to have 4 high speed cores, and 4 slower cores. the general idea is that the system workloads can be managed by the os'es thread scheduler, and be placed on to the lowest power consuming core that is still adequate for the job. both phones are fine with multitasking. i didn't actually notice any performance difference is the ui or in application speeds, but i also am not a mobile gamer... i would expect for the difference to be most obvious there (assuming there is one). i was a little surprised when the 3 xl came out with 4gb of ram (since i didn't know if that would be enough), but that worked out well. the 3a xl has the same 4gb of ram and therefore has similar performance.notable differences not aleady mentionedoddly, the pixel 3a xl has a headphone jack. that's noteworthy because the 3 xl does not have a headphone jack. i know there are some ""purists"" that are anti-bluetooth, but i'd say that a phone is not an audiophile platform anyway. even if you have awesome $1500 headphones, i can still tell you that the dac in your sub-170 gram phone is junk (comparatively). one of the really nice features of the pixel 3 xl is that it's waterproof... the 3a xl is not. it's not a dealbreaker for me, but i can see where this would affect some peoples' choices.in conclusion, i thought the deal i got on amazon when i bought my 3a xl was so good that i bought the phone without even knowing if i'd get a service plan for it. now that the 3a xl is at its ""normal"" price i still think it's an incredible deal, and i really question anyone who would buy a different phone at this device's price point. highly recommended.",,,,,,,,,
